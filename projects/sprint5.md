## Volunteery

Have you ever wanted to volunteer on a free weekend but had no idea how to get started? Or perhaps you are a part of a non-profit that could do with more people to help? 🤝

Presenting **Volunteery**, the solution to all the times you want to do some good. ✨

## 🙋 So, how does it work?

It's simple! You sign in as a volunteer or non-profit manager - and depending on your role, you can find new places to volunteer at, or add new events for people to find! 🔎

## 👨‍🏭 Who are we?

This project was built by Pod 1.1.3 Team 1, [AB Satyaprakash](https://github.com/imperial-lord), [Preet Shah](https://github.com/shahpreetk), [Shambhavi Aggarwal](https://github.com/agg-shambhavi) and [Ankit Maity](https://github.com/QEDK).

## 💻 What did we build this with?

Volunteery is completely made with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev). 🎐 And for all our backend services, Volunteery uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com). 🔥

## 🔜 What's next?

- Integrate our service with educational institutions which have credits for social work. 🏫
- Make a custom ML-assisted algorithm for the best outcomes. 🤖
- Gamify the experience with badges, ranks and custom merch. 👕

Where we want to be:

- An integrated end-to-end platform between volunteers and non-profits. 🧑🏿‍🤝‍🧑🏿
